This is a non-recursive Sudoku Solver capable of solving "easy" and most "normal" level difficulty sudokus.

There is no UI, but it should be straightforward to use. For each line, type the numbers given in the unsolved sudoku and fill in the blanks with the number 0.

The program will return the solved sudoku, or will atleast solve as much as it is capable of solving.
